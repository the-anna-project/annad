# client
Documentation about the client described here refers the go [client
package](https://godoc.org/github.com/xh3b4sd/anna/client). This package
provides a client implementation of Anna's API in [golang](https://golang.org),
used to communicate with the [server](server.md). See also the godoc of [the
server package](https://godoc.org/github.com/xh3b4sd/anna/server). The client
described here is used for instance in the
[annactl](https://godoc.org/github.com/xh3b4sd/anna/annactl) package. For more
information on this one see [the annactl documentation](annactl.md). The
current implementation of the client and the server makes use of
https://github.com/go-kit/kit.
