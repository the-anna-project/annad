# requirements
To develop and run the project's unit tests there is only your favorite editor
and https://golang.org `>=go1.7` required.

There is a redis storage implementation. Using this, a running http://redis.io
instance is required. For convenience this can be run in a docker container.
Obviously, then, https://www.docker.com is required as well.
