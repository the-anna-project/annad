This is the 22th diary entry. After some vacation it is time to continue.

The last time was and still is full of conceptual work, research and trying to
understand how things could work out. An interesting piece to read is this:
http://www.kfki.hu/~csdori/Concepts.pdf. Here I came to the idea that live is
about interacting with the objects around us. For Anna, the objects around her
are bytes. Her business is to find out how to deal with them. Finding out what
ones are important and what actions are required under certain circumstances.
Since I already stated similar ideas in the past, I have the feeling my mental
model is getting clearer and clearer with every new research. I am doing 360s
all the time. All the ideas and concepts are already there. Still, it is rather
hard to go further and foster a structured view of how it should be "at the
end". Note that there will never be an end. Anyway, some practilcal work needs
to be done.

One funny thing happened. Out of nothing the project got interest by somebody.
Now there is a user on github "watching" the project. Even this is a very very
small step, it is an important one that actually feels good. There is
potential, as I said.
