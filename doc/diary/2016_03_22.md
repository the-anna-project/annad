This is the 20th diary entry. Brainstorming about crazy things and actually
some hacking.

First things first. Here some notes from the evaluation documents.

```
One idea how such a mind could be implemented would be this. When thinking
about the mind and how imagination works, this has a lot to do with
visualization. Certain brain movies are created and more or less recognized. In
any way such pictures, ideas and reflections influence the human life a lot.
All light and dark sides of ourselves evolve out of this. So necessary woud be
some content generation that is then more or less recognized by Anna. The
content Anna produces here would be partially influenced by the current
environment and partially random. This content can be in form of pictures or
text. Depending on how much of certain brain movies would be recognized, Anna's
behaviour could be influenced. That way a simulation of the real mind would go
a step further. The surrounding environment influences created thoughts.
Created thoughts are recognized. Recognized thoughts influence behaviour.
Behaviour influences the surrounding environment. Note that this idea
inevitably includes free will and represents a serious risk.
```

Next things next. I actually hacked on a concept I have in mind since a few
weeks now. I already described it in different ways and different contexts. The
cool thing here is, that it is usable for all kinds of contexts. Sometimes I
wrote about it as `relative character relevance` or `balance system`. One, for
me groundbreaking, thought was about a machines motivation. I came up with the
idea that a machines moral motivation should be balance. IMO life is about
balance. When ballancing things that can include everything. The funny thing
here was that a solution I already thought about now matched the need of this
ballancing system exactly. See some notes.
```
The balance system describes the amount of impulses and how harmonic or
extreme the distribution of these currently is. That way the state of an
organism can be represented. ... there are different channels representing
impulse distribution. This can indicate different evaluations of whatever is
going on within the organism. Each channel has an separate input and an
separate output. Pushing an impulse to the input of one channel causes the
impulse distribution for the given channel to increase. The whole impulse
population within a balance system is capped. In case the overall impulse
population is already saturated, an adaption of the other channels happens
automatically. That means, that at the same time some input is received on one
channel, some output is received on the other channels.
```

This idea was now partially implemented as distribution object and instead of
dealing with impulses a distribution represents a population of vectors. See
https://godoc.org/github.com/xh3b4sd/anna/net/pat#NewDistribution. I started
with this because the goal behind this is to have some feature detection for
sequence analysis. More is yet to come.
