This is the 25th diary entry. One step closer to CLG profile creation.

I managed to implement the CLG profile creation in the first iteration. This
involved the setup of an environment in which Anna can be integrated. For now
there is a local environment in this repository:
https://github.com/xh3b4sd/anna.local. The name is quite cool because the
domain for the Anna project is https://anna.earth. The domain for the local
environment is http://anna.local. The `anna.local` environment boots up a
[Vagrant]() box using [Virtualbox]() provider and sets up necessary components
such as [Redis](http://redis.io), [Grafana](http://grafana.org),
[Prometheus](https://prometheus.io), [Traefik](https://traefik.io) and, of
course, [Anna](https://anna.earth). The whole environment is only for the local
integration to have something that runs the project using a single command.
Thus there is no effort to make this setup redundant and distributed. Here a
few words on the different components.

- Vagrant and Virtualbox is simply used to bring some encapsulated box up. I
  hate the state of the art in bootstrapping machines these days. I would like
  to fix this shit we are dealing with today, but this is not my focus now. So
  I am living with what it is today. The booted machine is a
  [CoreOS](https://coreos.com) providing [etcd](https://github.com/coreos/etcd)
  and [fleet](https://github.com/coreos/fleet).
- Redis is used for persistent storage. I know Redis is maybe not the best fit
  in the long term, but it was the best fit to get started with. It is fast and
  I am used to it. Anyway all data is written into a single redis instance in
  the local environemnt.
- Grafana is used for metric visualization. Here we can create shiny dashboards
  to get an idea of what is going on inside Anna.
- Prometheus is a monitoring system. It scrapes metrics from the configured
  endpoints and exposes them to other services. Here Prometheus fetches metrics
  from Anna's `/metrics` endpoint. Stored metrics are consumed by Grafana in
  this setup.
- Traefik is a dynamic load balancer. It reads backends from `etcd` and
  registers them. Incoming requests are forwarded to the configured backends.
