This is the 5th diary entry. Regarding the precedeing diary entry:
[2016.01.17](2016_01_17.md).

It turned out to be problematic snapshotting the networks state. From the
current point of view, all interactions causing weird states can simply be
stopped for snapshotting. What causes interaction within a network is an
`impulse`. In case no impulse is going through the network, no activity happens
at all. The network keeps its current state, but does not change anymore. This
concept of controlling state changes and activity within networks makes
snapshotting reliable and easy. Impulses can be blocked by simply closing the
gateways. Gateways? Read on!

Interfaces were defined yesterday, but as always, the first shot is simply the
first shot. See the [core concept
documentation](https://github.com/xh3b4sd/anna/blob/b16ed18e115219a030a0e0b689ad75a71e54498f/doc/concept/core.md).
