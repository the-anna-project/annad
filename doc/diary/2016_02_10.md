This is the 11th diary entry. Log control was implemented.

Process wise this iteration was quite rough at the beginning. Question was how
the logging interface should look like. The problem with logging interfaces is
that information for log control need to be provided. That means the user
interface gets bloated with each new information that will be applied.

Further a challenge is to modify runtime configuration of the logger. We need
to consider that maybe houndrets of thousand or even millions of neurons will
use the logger.

How does it now look like? The following shows the usage of a new logger. When
logging messages the call to the logger takes log tags that are used to
determine if the log messages should be printed under current log
configurations. See https://godoc.org/github.com/xh3b4sd/anna/spec#Tags for
explanations of the tags usage. So I opted for this.

```go
newLog.Line("msg", "hello, I am Anna")
```

For further information read [logging](/doc/concept/logging.md), [log
control](/doc/concept/control.md#log) and [annactl](/doc/concept/annactl.md).

Besides proper logging and log control, the text interface command scheme was
aligned to the log control command. There were also zsh autocompletion scripts
added to ease the use of `anna` and `annactl` binaries.
