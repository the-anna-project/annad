This is the 13th diary entry. More thinking in sleepless nights.

It took some time to go through reasearch topics and generate ideas about how
to go further. This diary entry alone took me nearly a week. The bottom line is
this. Now Anna needs to think. She needs to think as dynamic and autonomous as
humans do. The problem is that there is no blue print of the minds inner
workings. No architecture overview. No rules. So I need to come up with this by
myself. Trial and error.

I was thinking about the concept of [complex logic gates](/doc/concept/clg.md).
They are supposed to build the base of human like understanding and doing by
transforming and connecting information and by transforming information into
behavior. Since this is a nice idea, I have no clue how to get there, not yet.
It felt totally crazy when I realized that the already existing equivalents are
logic gates in computers. They are the base of translating information in form
of zeros and ones (or simply current off, current on) into behavior in form of
current flow within circuites. It feels like I am building a new generation of
computers.

Here are some links I found during research and brainstorming.
