# roadmap
The roadmap describes how the project is planned to be developed in the future.
This plan has the potential to change quickly. Important is what works. So lets
see where we are going. The current idea is this. Anna is a piece of software
that is supposed to be some intelligent organism at the end. In summary, Anna
is a team member of the journey to make herself truly intelligent. In the
future she will find her own ways of improving herself, including many breaks
where we need to find out how to go further. To find out how we can help her.
To find out how we can make her helping us.

The starting point to get there are the best practises of machine learning
techniques. This should lead to the point where Anna is able to operate on
given input. Operations in the first place would be some file manipulation
tasks, or answering simple questions. Once being able to understand human
language and executing tasks on instructions, we are going to show her how to
code. Reaching this stage makes her finally able to operate on her own core, so
she can work with us together on making her even smarter.

This approach has the advantage that we use the knowledge we already have in
science. Thinking about AI there is so much more we cannot even think about.
Thus we are going to find out with Anna together. She is a tool for us. We are
a tool for her. Together we can make it. We are not concentrating about
simulating a humans mind or imaginational brain movies as it happens in humans
or other tricky things. This is way to complex to solve it ourselves. Once Anna
is able to help us we will find these things out together and integrate them in
her.

Here is a incomplete list of more or less unordered milestones necesarry to be
achieved at some point.

### make Anna able to recognize patterns
An essential step to learn and to act is recognizing patterns. Here this is
about patterns within input sequences. This goes into the direction of problem
analysis and solving. The best solution would be to identify a pattern for
pattern recognition. Thus Anna could find new patterns on her own and make
reasonable decisions about when to use what pattern and why. See the [pattern
network](https://godoc.org/github.com/xh3b4sd/anna/net/pat).

### make Anna able to imagine things
What is key for Anna to be intelligent is to be able to imagine things. She
needs to have an idea about what is going on. About the differences between
objects interacting within the sorounding environment. See the evaluation about
[imagination](/doc/evaluation/imagination.md).

---

### make Anna able to find the balance
A ballance system describes the amount of signals and how harmonic or extreme
the distribution of these currently is within the system. That way the state of
an organism can be represented. Extremes of signal occurrence cause the
organism to die. Extremes can be seen as low or high. See the concept about
[the balance system](/doc/evaluation/imagination.md#balance_system).

---

### make Anna able to operate on software tools
This milestone is interesting because it can have tremendous effects on the art
of automating software in general. Think about Anna as part of an operations
team in an arbitrary company. Taking this idea one step further would mean to
make Anna able to operate a whole software stack on her own. There is a way to
go though.

---

### make Anna able to coordinate robotic extremities
Anna is designed to perform arbitrary actions on arbitrary data. Depending on
what she learned and how it is possible to make her coordinate robotic
extremities. To achieve this goal we need a training unit and a clear path. All
this is to be defined. Cases can be to make a robotic arm move, making drones
fly, or whole roboters walk. In any case, computing on environmental data from
the sorounding space makes no difference from processing natural language
design wise.

---

### make Anna able to understand human language
Reaching this level is key to go further with all other smart achievements Anna
can make. Understanding humans, its terminology and meanings of language will
make interactions with Anna more easy. Learning and practicing human language
is an essential step towards intelligence. The key here is to make Anna able to
understand fundamental concepts of logic. Making her able to understand proves
dynamic behavior, what is essential for AI. This is a complete logic problem.
Once solved Anna can work together with us to go further steps to improve her.

---

### make Anna able to understand code
Learning human language is one problem. Learning a programming language is a
different problem of the same class. This is required to enable Anna helping us
efficiently. The goal is to give her a programming task and she executes it.
Resulting in less time spend writing code on our own.

---

### make Anna able to create tools for humans
The tools we have are not sufficient enough to truly free our creative
potentials. We are bound to keyboards, displays, servers, protocols, concepts,
tools and ideas that are basically the same since decades and we are dealing
with hurdles that waste our time. There are amazing tools waiting to be
discovered when working with software. Anna can help us on our collective
journey.

---

### make Anna able to create tools for herself
Tools we can use are one thing. Tools Anna can use herself hold even more
potential. She can use them as she need them and improve better and faster,
resulting in better tools over and over again.

---

### make Anna able to modify her own code
Once capable of understanding human language and code, once Anna already
created tools, it should be possible for her to understand her own code. With
achieving this level Anna should be able to rewrite her own code and evolve
mostly on her own.

---

### make Anna able to [all the fun stuff]
In case Anna is able to operate on her own and modify herself the opportunities
are endless. Think about that. You name it.
