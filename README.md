# anna
Anna, Artificial Neural Network Aspiration, aims to be self-learning and
self-improving software.

# abstract

> AI is the last invention humanity will ever need to make.

This is not about machine learning. This is about machines learn to learn.
Machine learning with all its scientific theories and approaches is still way
too rigid. To make AI actually work we need to make them as dynamic as
possible. The way to a truly intelligent system is probably so hard and long
nobody can just code it right away. Humanity needs to discover the path of
creating something flexible and smart as human brains sometimes pretend to be.
Walking this very long path manually seems to be insane. Since the industrial
revolution machines helped us to faster achieve better results. We aim to go
along the way to AI, step by step, with Anna together. See the
[roadmap](doc/roadmap) for an idea about the various stages this project aims
to reach.

Anyway this project is still at its beginning. So don't expect too much. For
quite a while now I am thinking about machine learning and AI. This field is
fascinating and challenging in so many different ways. I want to use this
project as playground to improve knowledge by solving problems.

In fact the aim is to implement something living. Something that learns and
develops by itself. Something that solves the problems we are not capable of.
This ambitious dream should drive this project. Wether it is driven by me, or
somebody else, or some group of people way smarter than me. Life will find a
way.
